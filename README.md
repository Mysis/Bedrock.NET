# Bedrock.NET
c# library that handles many aspects of addon creation

This repo is a Visual Studio 2019 project.

note: This is a project I've been working on in my own time to assist me in development of shapescape related projects. I've put it here as a repo so that any shapescape member can use it, since a few have expressed interest. I may make the source of the library available publicly on my personal github page at some point in the future.

#### Quick Start

1. Create a new solution in Visual Studio
2. Add this repo as a git submodule in the directory of the solution. (`git submodule add https://github.com/ShapescapeMC/Bedrock.NET.git path/to/place`)
3. Any new projects you create will need to add Bedrock.NET as a reference.
