# Bedrock.NET

#### c# library that handles many aspects of addon creation

This repo is a Visual Studio 2019 project. It is also missing a lot of features, so if you want to use this for something, you should ask me if the library is currently capable of doing what you want. Documentation is coming, but it may take a while for me to write.

#### Quick Start

1. Create a new solution in Visual Studio
2. Add this repo as a git submodule in the directory of the solution. (`git submodule add https://github.com/ShapescapeMC/Bedrock.NET.git path/to/place`)
3. Any new projects you create will need to add Bedrock.NET as a reference.
